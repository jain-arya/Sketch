# Sketch
To convert image to sketch 

Here are the steps of how the code is working:
1) Converts the image to grayscale.
2) Inverts the grayscale image to emphasize edges.
3) Blurs the inverted image for a soft glow effect.
4) Inverts the blurred image back to create a base layer for the sketch.
5) Divides the grayscale image by the inverted blur to enhance edges and details, creating a sketch-like effect.
